So...What’s a style guide anyway and why and when do I need one?
</p>

<p>
A style guide is a collection of pre-designed elements, graphics and rules to follow to help make sure each page of a website will look and feel consistent to the site’s users.
</p>
<p>
<div class="icon icon-toolbox"></div>
Think of a style guide as a toolbox, and yourself as the handyman
When a handyman needs to build something he’s always going to go to the toolbox and choosing the right tools for the job. He’s not going to go buy new tools everytime he needs to build a chair. And if that handyman has other people helping him build chairs he’ll want them all to look the same, so he will have not only a set of tools for them to use, but a set of rules as well.
</p>
<p>
When you’re going to build a web page, you’re going to have this guide you can reference and choose the right tool for the job, except instead of hammers, nails, and measuring tape, you’ll have typography, components, and spacing.
</p>
<p>
Having a style guide is important, especially when you’re on a team with multiple designers & developers all working on a massive web site or an application with many different states. The guide will help to ensure that people aren’t just making stuff up as they go. 
There will be times when the components you have in your style guide won’t do the job and you have to add something else, but don’t worry. That’s perfectly fine as long as the addition is truly needed. 
</p>
<p>
If you’re able to write HTML and CSS, or even better yet SASS or have a team member that can, it would be a great idea to code up a live version of the styleguide where developers can go and grab actual code while developing your designs.
</p>
<p>
If you’re trying to create a guide for components that already exist, but aren’t organized in any specific way, this course can help you do that, but I think you’ll also find this course helpful if you’re starting from scratch on a new project. So now that you kind of understand the concept behind why you would actually want to use a style guide, let’s talk about what might be in one in the next video.
</p>
<p>
Let’s talk about the different components a styleguide should contain.
</p>
<h3>
Branding 
</h3>
<p>
Before you get started, the first thing you’ll want to consider is the Brand. Chances are, if you’re taking this course you have a site in mind that you want to create a style guide for. What will the site represent? What’s the vision, the mission, the values of that site? These things should be kept in mind during the entire process. 
</p>
<h3>
Typography
</h3>
<p>
Next, with the brand in mind we’ll want to define the typography. Typography is one of, if not the most important part of a website and can be tricky to get right. I won’t be going into the various theories behind typography in this course. We’ll just be focusing on defining a base size, color, and weight for body copy, links, buttons, headlines, etc.
</p>
<h3>
Tone 
</h3>
<p>
Tone of Voice is also important. Instead of using filler text like Lorem Ipsum, it’s better to write content with the tone that aligns with your brand. Error text on an input for example: instead of using lorem ipsum or simply typing “this is an error”. Try something like “Sorry, this field is required.”
</p>
<h3>
Layout 
</h3>
<p>
Creating a general rule for spacing is a good idea. This will help you define your grid, space between elements, sizes for buttons, etc.
</p>
<h3>
Color 
</h3>
<p>
Color is very important to identify in your style guide. You don’t want 50 different shades of blue showing up on your massive website because developers simply didn’t have the hexcode on hand. By defining primary colors for things like buttons, links, and navbars as well as secondary colors for alerts, errors, and labels you can avoid that headache.
</p>
<h3>
Iconography
</h3>
<p>
Icons can be a great help in communicating information to the users of the website. Some error text in a box might not be clear to the user that something is wrong, but put an alert icon next to it and it might be more clear. It’s important that the icons you choose for your site fit the brand. If you’re trying to create a relationship of trust and stability with your website, you probably want to use clean and simple icons. If you’re trying to create a hip fun and vibrant atmosphere, maybe you go with something more bold and colorful.
</p>
<h3>
Imagery 
</h3>
<p>
Imagery can be used in a variety of ways. On a hero image accompanied by a call to action, above a block of text to help further the readers’ context, or simply by itself. The image could be a stock photo, a snapshot of teammates for the about page, or illustrations helping to describe a product. In any case, imagery should fit the brand and be used as a tool to engage users. Its good to have examples of these situations in your style guide.
</p>
<h3>
Forms 
</h3>
<p>
Forms allow users to interact with your site. Whether they’re filling out a contact form or entering in credit card information, forms are crucial. You want to make sure all of the different states are clear to the user. What’s it look like when the user clicks into an input or enters an invalid email address? What’s the tone of voice being used when giving feedback to that user?
</p>
<h3>
Buttons 
</h3>
<p>
Buttons can be created by making use of our color, spacing, typography, and tone choices. We’ll also need to account for different states just like we do for the forms.
</p>
<h3>
Other components
</h3>
<p>
You can use the same principles used to create forms and buttons to create all your other components, like alerts and navbars.
